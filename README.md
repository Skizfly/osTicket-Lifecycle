<h1>Closing Issues in osTicket</h1>
In this exercise, I guide through the entire journey and examine the lifecycle of a ticket, covering its inception to resolution using the open-source help desk ticketing system, osTicket.<br />


<h2>Stages in the Ticket Life Cycle</h2>

To generate tickets, users access the ticket portal and log in if required. In this space, users submit requests, outlining their IT issues. I've generated three tickets illustrating diverse problems encountered in a real-world environment. Tickets include a Help Topic, a concise issue summary, and details presented akin to an email.

As an administrator, ticket requests are received in their panel upon submission. Admins can then redistribute tickets to an agent or suitable team. The issue's severity level is assessed and assigned to ensure timely resolution within an SLA. In this instance, Jane reviewed the ticket, reassigned it to the System Administrators, and updated the severity level to Emergency.

Effective ticket resolution hinges on robust communication. Collaborate with both the team and impacted users. Various tickets, each with distinct issues, are appropriately assigned. John receives a ticket from Jane, while Jane adeptly handles a ticket independently. Thorough documentation is pivotal for a thriving environment. Properly documented tickets serve as valuable references in case similar issues arise in the future.

<h2>Knowledge Gained</h2>
Approaches to ticket management vary based on the work setting. Quotas may dictate the number of resolved tickets within a timeframe, and prioritization is situation-dependent. Constructing osTicket from the ground up enhanced my comprehension of IT ticketing dynamics.
